# Question-oriented Hierarchical Transport Model
Yuxi Lab develops an an autonomous method for calculating molecular junction charge transport, aiming to bridge the significant technical gap between simplified physical model and ab initio quantum transport methods. Guided by practical research problems, this method innovatively applies a hierarchical simplification of device structures combined with an optimized calculation precision strategy. It integrates Extended Hückel Molecular Orbital Theory (EHMO), Semi-Empirical Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB), and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method. Additionally, it employs techniques such as the wide-band approximation and energy level renormalization (DFT+Σ correction) to efficiently calculate the charge transport properties of molecular junction devices at atomic resolution. Thanks to its hierarchical approximation strategy and multiple optimization methods, the benchmark system calculations have shown a speed improvement by orders of magnitude without compromising result accuracy compared to mainstream transport calculation software.
