# Case 2 - L1 scheme - molecule + CSC-EHT
> In the study published in _Angewandte Chemie_ titled 'Fano Resonance in Single-Molecule Junctions', Hong, et al. observed Fano resonance phenomena in para-carbazole anion structures at room temperature using electrochemically gated scanning tunneling microscope break junction (EC-STM-BJ) technology. This experimental observations are supported with DFT+NEGF transport calculations in the paper.

Fano resonance is a unique quantum interference phenomenon generated by interactions of molecular electronic states, and computational scheme **L1** is still applicable. Besides that, it also considers the charged characteristics of the molecular system, introducing a charge self-consistency step to address the effects of charge redistribution on electronic structure, namely the 'Molecule + CSC-EHT' model. 

This model successfully reproduced the antisymmetric Fano peak features in the anionic transmission spectra. Analysis of its intrinsic electronic structure revealed that the Fano resonance was caused by interference between localized HOMO and delocalized LUMO across the molecular backbone, initiated by injecting negative charge into the molecular center. Additionally, by placing counter ions near the charge center and adjusting their distances, the charge screening effects were controlled, enabling the manipulation of the appearance position of Fano resonance features in the transmission spectrum. 

Benefited from the simplified treatment of electron interactions and the efficiency of matrix construction by the EHT, the CSC-EHT approach maintains high computational efficiency, even with the introduction of a charge self-consistent process. Theoretically speaking, it is closer to more precise methods such as DFT, while being more cost-effective in terms of computational expenses (about 1 minute on a personal computer).
