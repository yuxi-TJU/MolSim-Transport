# Question-oriented Hierarchical Transport Model

## Introduction
Our lab develops an autonomous method for calculating molecular junction charge transport, aiming to bridge the significant technical gap between simplified physical model and ab initio quantum transport methods. Guided by practical research problems, this method innovatively applies a hierarchical simplification of device structures combined with an optimized calculation precision strategy.

## Innovative Approach
It integrates Extended Hückel Molecular Orbital Theory (EHMO), Semi-Empirical Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB), and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method. Additionally, it employs techniques such as the wide-band approximation and energy level renormalization (DFT+Σ correction) to efficiently calculate the charge transport properties of molecular junction devices at atomic resolution. Thanks to its hierarchical approximation strategy and multiple optimization methods, the benchmark system calculations have shown a speed improvement by orders of magnitude without compromising result accuracy compared to mainstream transport calculation software.

## Performance and Benefits

## Demonstration
To illustrate the practical application and effectiveness of our hierarchical TB transport model, we present a detailed protocol using the 1,3-BDT molecule, known for its destructive quantum interference (DQI) feature, as a case study.

## Model Validation through Diverse Research Examples
In our exploration with the Question-Oriented Hierarchical Transport Model, we have undertaken a nuanced approach towards molecular structure systems based on the specific objectives of our research. Our methodology involves varying degrees of simplification of the molecular systems, categorized into three distinct modeling systems for clarity and precision: the bare molecule, the extended molecule, and the device.

To demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our model, we selected six representative systems that have been previously reported in experimental research works by scholars in the field. These systems serve as benchmarks, allowing us to validate the accuracy and efficiency of our model, as well as its practical utility in addressing real-world scientific problems. Here is a brief introduction to the origins and characteristics of these six systems:

1. System 1 - This system
2. System 2 - This system Fano Resonance charged molecule
3. System 3 - This system DQI in the heterocyclic molecule
4. System 4 - This system
5. System 5 - This system
6. System 6 - This system biased device rectifier in ferrocenyl molecule
